# CPS-data-analysis-and-ML-in-R
The analysis  draws on data provided by the Crown Prosecution Services (CPS) from 2014 to 2017 (4 years). National data was employed, focusing on the Number of Successful Convictions  recorded over the years publicly provided by the Crown Prosecution Service


The Principal Offence Category data set has the breakdown of different crimes and their 
outcome and s, also includes the location of each offence and a National summary per month. 
The general categories are the location, Number of Convictions per crime, Percentage of 
convictions per crime, Number of Convictions Unsuccessful, and Percentage of Convictions 
Unsuccessful. We have data for this analysis for four years (2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017). 
The crimes explored in this data set include Homicide, Burglary, Robbery, Theft and 
handling, Fraud and forgery, Criminal damage, Drug offences, Public order, Sexual offences, 
Crimes against the person Motoring and All other offences excluding motoring. The data 
we are working with is presented in multiple files with different months and years. The 
files, however, contain similar data with the same heading and an equal number of 
columns. 
This report explores the interdependencies of crime and the criminal justice 
system. We aim to analyse available data to identify trends that will have a future 
application in predicting which counties are safe and which counties require more 
government funding to reduce the rate of crimes for counties in the United Kingdom.
Our objective involves exploring the data available and extracting valuable insights from it. 
We will focus on preparing and cleaning the data and analysing the data with various data 
exploration techniques (Exploratory Data Analysis). Then, we will run predictive data 
analysis using Machine Learning algorithms. For this report, we will limit our predictive 
models to (1) Linear regression technique, (2) Clustering technique, and (3) classification n 
technique. This report analysis will focus on Descriptive data analysis and Predictive data 
analysis.
